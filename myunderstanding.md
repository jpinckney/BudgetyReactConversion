from commit 2 to commit 3 i made changes because on commit 2 i was trying to update state with state. Thus state was successfully changing depending on inputs, but it was not actually saving anything. On commit 3 i added  the incomeCopy and expenseCopy variable in the income and expense method. while using the spread operator it is copying the input when the user hits the check mark and creates and object and stores it in the income array on state. object shorthand {descriptionInput, descriptionValue} is the name of the key:value pair in the new object being created
